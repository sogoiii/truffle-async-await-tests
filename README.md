Truffle with Async await tests
--------
This repo is an example on how to use async await tests with truffle. I have a full tutorial on [medium](https://medium.com/@angellopozo/testing-solidity-with-truffle-and-async-await-396e81c54f93).


Requirements
--------
1. Node ≥ 7.6 confirm by entering node -v in command line
2. npm ≥ 4 confirm by entering npm -v in command line
3. Truffle ≥ 3.3 confirm by entering truffle -v in command line
4. Ganach-cli ≥ 5.0.0 confirm by entering testrpc -v in command line

Install truffle and ganache once you have node and npm installed:

npm install -g truffle
npm install -g ganache-cli

Setup
--------
1. git clone https://github.com/sogoiii/truffle-async-await-tests
2. cd truffle-async-await-tests
3. npm install or yarn install
4. truffle compile
5. truffle test
